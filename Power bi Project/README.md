## Problem Statement:



Mr. Patel, is having difficulty getting accurate and reliable insights into the sales performance of his company, particularly in the different regions of India. He is relying on regional managers to provide him with information, but he believes that they may not be presenting the full picture or may be exaggerating the data. Mr. Patel wants to find a way to get a clear and accurate understanding of the sales performance of his company, particularly in terms of revenues and customers, in order to make data-driven decisions and increase sales. One potential solution that Mr. Patel is considering is using a dashboard tool such as Power BI to track and visualize the data, allowing him to see the real numbers and make informed decisions.
