# Flight Fare Prediction application:

### Problem Statement

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted.

### About the Project

A Flight price prediction application which predicts fares of flight for a particular date based on various parameters like Source, Destination, Stops & Airline.Data used in this Project is publicly available at Kaggle. The dataset goes through Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling , Exploratory Data Analysis which gives insights about the data and later uses Machine Learning techniques to train the data for prediction.
It is a regression problem which is solved using RandomForestRegressor ML Algorithm which generates accurate results for price prediction. A web application is created using Flask through which user can interact and get accurate prediction of flight fares.
